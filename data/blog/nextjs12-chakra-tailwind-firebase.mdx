Starting my journey into commerical web development I thought I'd start with my very own website to showcase my abilities and test my knowledge. I chose to go with Next.js as it runs incredibly fast giving me rapid response times on my website and making it an all around pleasant experience for my users.

**_Example code segment_**

```
if (code === true) {
  return code
} else {
  return "Please fix code"
}
```

My previous experience with Next.js and CSS Modules was a tiresome one, I decided to go with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. At first glace I found Tailwind disgusting. However after playing around with the module I grew to love its simplicity. The addons for VSCode were incredibly helpful for their use of intellisense on the classnames. After everything I think its safe to say, I have fallen in love with the library and will likely use it in upcoming projects. Stay Tuned.

Finally, hosting was an entirely new ball game for me. I decided to use firebase and its free hosting services. Having very limited use of the software in the past I thought a deep dive in setting things up and using the docs would be beneficital in the long run. Alas I was wrong. After using github actions to setup a good continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline. Changes and updates were a breeze.

**However** I encounted one glaring bug. Firebase when refreshed would send my website to the homepage, no matter what page the user had navigated to. Google returned little results but from what I did manage to gather this was a firebase specific issue. I changed provider over to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and with a seemless integration with my Github account, CI/CD was implemented yet again and my site ran flawlessly.
